# Portfolio Selection Using Genetic Algorithm

[Blog Post](https://jaumecloquellcapo.github.io/jaumeCloquellCapo.github.io/sharpe-ratio-risk.html)

## What is it?

The objective of this repository is to use genetic algorithms to address the problem of optimizing investment portfolios.  It is intended that the proposed models use Sharpe's risk measure and that they solve the limitations presented by the classical Markowitz model.  The aim is to demonstrate, with its results in terms of performance, that they are a tool to be taken into account by investors and managers.
